# Reference guides

The only purpose of a reference guide is to describe, as succinctly as possible, and in an orderly way. Whereas the content of tutorials and how-to guides are led by needs of the user, reference material is led by the product it describes.

In the case of software, reference guides describe the software itself - APIs, classes, functions and so on - and how to use them.
